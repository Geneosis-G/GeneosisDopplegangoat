Who am I?

Am I a goat? Am I a cow? Am I a human ? Am I a demon? Am I a robot?
Who knows... I might even be all that at the same time!

[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]Here it is, once and for all, the legendary Dopplegangot is alive XD This mod was probably the most requested of them all, and for good reasons, who would not want to play as a random citizen in this game :p This mod was also a great reason for me not to include models in other mutators I made, because I didn't want to spread the work needed to make a model playable in various mods when I can have it all in this one :) Also, I did wait long enough to be sure that no more model would be added to the game after I release this mod, because updating it with new models would have been a real pain X)
Anyway, that's it, this mod required exactly the ammount of work I expected for it, and hopefully part of that work was simplified by the code I already produced for the Goatymon NPCs ^^ So basically I made a huuuuge list of every single character model available in the game files, and I tried to apply them to the player. Some models needed little tweaks in term of animation and collision, but overall most models were working really well on their own. Then I was really happy to discover that the Payday characters animations could be applied to every single human NPC in the game! Meaning that player-controlled humans all have wonderful and seamless animations, compared to what they had when possessed by Ghost Goat for example.
Finally, most of the time on this mod was to gather and stick together the skin, physics, animations and collision size of every model, for a total of 344 models avaliable for you to play with... So enjoy your multiple forms :D
